## Motives
Recently, there are plenty of students ask for solutions or a better way to accomplish tasks on Mac. We realize Mac might be a little different from Windows, which is still very popular nowadays, so we decided to set up an introductory course to help students cross over the gap.

"Mac is unbelievable, don't ever lose faith on Mac only because of not being able to get familiar with it in a few days." We are certainly not the professionals, but we are glad to share some of our experience with Mac with the community.

## Objectives

By the end of the course, you should be able to accomplish the following objectives:

* Learn basic Terminal commands
* Be able to develop in Visual Studio Code.
* Identify the useful, productive tools on macOS.
* Know your Mac better.
* Work with git and GitHub.
* Build an entire gaming project on Mac.
* etc.

We hope that through an extensive series of lessons, students will be able to grasp the ideas and further explore more contents. It is encouraged to share your thoughts, ideas, and questions with every one who is learning to be a better Mac user.
