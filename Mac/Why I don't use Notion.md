#Notion

Never thought of using Notion, but it seems like a trend nowadays. Might dive into it later. 

Main reasons I don't see Notion fit into my workflow:

1. Web-based tool (slow access and less secure)
2. Notion is **tooooo fancy**
3. All-in-one tool is generally not the best ones in each area
	+ GTD: OmniFocus
	+ Note-taking: Obsidian and Notability
	+ Team Project Management: Asana 

	> So why notion?
