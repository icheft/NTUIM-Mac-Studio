# Using Safari on Mac Instead of Chrome


## Reasons (Pros)

1. Better privacy
2. Consistent style and settings
3. Enhanced system integration
	+ touch bar
	+ handoff 
	+ auto fill-in (verification)
	+ **keychain**
	+ picture-in-picture
4. Longer battery life (on Mac)
5. Syncing with iCloud (why you should use iMessage)
7. Fast

## Cons 

+ Extensions aren't that robust
+ Lack of control (in comparison to Chrome)
+ Only built for Apple

## Usage

+ Normally I use Safari for everything 
+ I use Chrome only when we're in a specific group meeting or project

> "But I do think Safari does have a lot more privacy and is quicker on a mac for sure. I'm using both browsers: Safari for browsing, Chrome for work."
> "But, after realizing that my Mac is always slow because I'm using Google Chrome, I switched to Safari."
