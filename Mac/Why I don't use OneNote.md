#OneNote 

Again, three reasons why I don't think OneNote fit into my workflow:

1. It's a Microsoft product, meaning that it doesn't go along well with MacBook in general
2. Fail to list out every *Notebook*
3. Not intuitive when it comes to collecting ideas 


OneNote, though, is still in my watchlist due to:

1. It used to be one of the most powerful note-taking tool
2. It's web clipping feature is something that can boost productivity
3. Easier to organize massive amount of (research) work
