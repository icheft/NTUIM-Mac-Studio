# Lec 03: Visual Studio Code Basics


+ Download your VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
+ My curated list of extensions and settings can be found [here](https://github.com/icheft/dotfiles/tree/master/vscode)
+ Jumpstarts:
    + [Freshmen](03-01_VSCodeBasics.md)
    + [Sophomores](03-02_VSCodePython.md)

## Preface

Since the VScode session is designed to be taught to NTUIM students, the contents I cover will mostly use C++ and Python usage as examples. 

The first part of the lecture aims to give students a fresh intake of what VSCode can do. Shortcuts and some coding hacks will be introduced here as well. To view more, please visit [the dedicated page](03-01_VSCodeBasics.md). 

The second part of this lecture shows the powerful Python extension within VSCode, and will use [mgt2001](https://github.com/icheft/mgt2001) (and its [doc](https://github.com/icheft/mgt2001-docs)) to demonstrate my setup throughout the MGT 2001 Statistics course taught in my department. Please visit [this page](03-02_VSCodePython.md) to see what you can do with Python.

## Pre-requisites

### Windows Users

+ C++: [Installing `c++/g++` on Windows](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~alee/g++/g++.html)
+ Python: 
    + [Installing Command Prompt for `python` on Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-command-prompt-for-python-in-windows10/)
    + I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) as well

### macOS Users

+ C++: I assume that you all have `g++` command installed
+ Python: 
    + Python 2 is pre-installed in macOS. Yet, Python 3 is not, and thus should be downloaded through [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Download the latest release.
    + I recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) as well
